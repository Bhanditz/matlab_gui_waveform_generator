matlab_gui_waveform_generator
=============================

A Matlab gui based waveform generator. Simply run the file, and define parameters like frequency, number of cycles and type of waveform (sine,cos,pwm etc) then click START. Also, when trying to generate new waveform, you need to press STOP, the go ahead with new waveform just like you did before. Cheers ;)
